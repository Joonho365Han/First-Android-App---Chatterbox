# First-Android-App---April-2015
This is the first Android application I ever developed with Android Studio.
It was a team project for a college computer software course and I was mainly responsible for the GUI.

The app was developed in Java, but the course was about C++ and no one knew Java at the time.
We had to figure out how to code in Java from a sample application given by the course teaching assistants.
The sample app automatically calculated the total amount of a bill after a tip is calculated.
I started to meddle with its .xml and .java file through Android Studio and learned the componentes and codes of the basic Android app.

This app is called Chatterbox and is a simple forum for TV show enthusiasts who enjoy discussions about a specific TV show depending on the topic.
It was inspired by my teammate Lindsey Dunphy, who also enjoys watching TV shows.
Creating this app not only taught me how to create an app in Java, but also gave me an experience of making valuable product for people other than me.
But the most important lesson was that to be a good programmer, you cannot know only one aspect of what you are working on.
Being the GUI programmer does not mean you do not have to know about the backend.
Being the Backend programmer does not mean you do not have to know about the GUI.
To make a good app, understand the interaction between each individual components are crucial, and this is the main difference between a technician and an engineer.
